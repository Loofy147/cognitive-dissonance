# Risk Register

This document outlines the key risks to the Self-Cognitive-Dissonance System, along with their likelihood, impact, and proposed mitigation strategies.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TECH-001** | **Cascading Failures due to Synchronous Calls**: A failure in one service can cause a chain reaction, bringing down the entire system. | High | High | - **Short-term**: Implement timeouts and retries for all service calls.<br>- **Long-term**: Decouple services using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka). |
| **TECH-002** | **Lack of Scalability**: The `docker-compose` setup is not suitable for production and cannot scale to handle increased load. | High | High | - Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart.<br>- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling to automatically scale services based on demand. |
| **TECH-003** | **Insecure Model Management**: Storing models as pickled files is insecure and does not provide proper versioning or auditing. | High | High | - Use a dedicated artifact store (e.g., MinIO, S3) for model storage.<br>- Implement a robust MLOps pipeline with MLflow for model versioning, tracking, and deployment. |
| **TECH-004** | **Data Pipeline Deficiencies**: The system lacks a proper data pipeline for training and evaluating models, leading to stale and potentially biased models. | High | Medium | - Implement a data pipeline using a tool like Apache Airflow or Kubeflow.<br>- Automate the model training and evaluation process to ensure models are regularly updated with fresh data. |
| **OPS-001** | **Limited Observability**: The lack of centralized logging, tracing, and alerting makes it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues in production. | High | High | - Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack, Loki).<br>- Use a distributed tracing tool (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to trace requests as they flow through the system.<br>- Set up alerting to notify the on-call team of any critical issues. |
| **OPS-002** | **Manual Deployment Process**: The manual deployment process is error-prone and slow, hindering the ability to release new features and bug fixes quickly. | High | Medium | - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.<br>- Automate the entire build, test, and deployment process. |
| **SEC-001** | **Lack of Authentication and Authorization**: The APIs are unsecured, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and malicious attacks. | High | High | - Implement an authentication and authorization solution (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).<br>- Enforce the principle of least privilege, giving each service only the permissions it needs to perform its function. |
| **SEC-002** | **Insufficient Input Validation**: The services do not perform sufficient input validation, making them susceptible to injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. | High | High | - Implement strict input validation for all API endpoints.<br>- Use a library like Pydantic to define and enforce data schemas. |
| **SEC-003** | **No Data Encryption**: Data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, exposing it to potential interception and theft. | High | High | - Encrypt all data at rest using a solution like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).<br>- Use TLS to encrypt all data in transit. |
| **COMP-001** | **Lack of Compliance**: The system has not been assessed for compliance with any relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), exposing the organization to potential legal and financial penalties. | Medium | High | - Conduct a compliance assessment to identify any gaps.<br>- Implement the necessary controls to achieve compliance with relevant regulations. |
