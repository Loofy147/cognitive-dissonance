# Adversarial Architecture Analysis: Cognitive Dissonance System

## Executive Summary

This analysis applies red-teaming principles to the Cognitive Dissonance microservice architecture, proactively identifying weaknesses through failure-oriented testing rather than traditional success-case validation.

---

## 1. Architecture Attack Surface

### 1.1 Service Topology Vulnerabilities

```
Proposer → Critic → Evaluator → Learner
                ↓
         Safety Gate
                ↓
        Meta-Controller
```

**Critical Weaknesses Identified:**

1. **No Observable Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Cascading failures could propagate through the entire chain
2. **Synchronous Dependencies**: Each service likely blocks waiting for downstream responses
3. **Single Point of Failure**: Safety Gate appears to be in the critical path
4. **Lack of Bulkhead Isolation**: Services share compute resources via docker-compose

---

## 2. MLP Neural Network Attack Vectors

### 2.1 Adversarial Input Exploitation

**Vulnerability**: Pre-trained MLP models (`proposer.pkl`, `critic.pkl`) without documented adversarial robustness.

**Attack Scenarios:**

```python
# Gradient-based adversarial examples
input_benign = [0.5, 0.5]
input_adversarial = [0.5 + ε, 0.5 + ε]  # Small perturbation
# May cause completely different classification

# Extreme value attacks
input_extreme = [1e100, -1e100]  # Causes numerical instability

# NaN/Inf injection
input_poisoned = [float('nan'), float('inf')]  # Bypasses validation?
```

**Red Team Task**: Create perturbations that flip predictions while remaining semantically similar.

### 2.2 Model Poisoning During Learning Phase

**Vulnerability**: `learner` service accepts training data without documented sanitization.

**Attack Scenarios:**

1. **Label Flipping**: Submit training examples with deliberately wrong labels
2. **Distribution Shift**: Feed examples from tail of distribution to skew model
3. **Gradient Explosion**: Submit sequence designed to cause exploding gradients
4. **Backdoor Injection**: Embed trigger patterns that cause specific misclassifications

---

## 3. Distributed System Failure Modes

### 3.1 Race Conditions

**Scenario: Concurrent Proposal Storm**
```
Time T0: Proposer A submits proposal-1
Time T0: Proposer B submits proposal-1 (same ID)
Time T1: Critic evaluates proposal-1 (which version?)
Time T2: Evaluator receives conflicting critic assessments
```

**Expected Weakness**: No distributed transaction coordination (no mention of Saga pattern, 2PC, or consensus)

### 3.2 Byzantine Failures

**Scenario: State Desynchronization**
```
1. Network partition isolates Meta-Controller
2. Proposer and Critic continue operating
3. Learner updates model based on stale meta-controller state
4. Network heals → conflicting system states
```

**Red Team Task**: Induce split-brain scenarios and verify recovery mechanisms.

### 3.3 Deadlock Potential

**Scenario: Circular Wait**
```
Evaluator waiting for Learner response
Learner waiting for Meta-Controller update
Meta-Controller waiting for Evaluator metrics
→ Deadlock if no timeout handling
```

## 4. Resource Exhaustion Vectors

### 4.1 Memory-Based Attacks

| Attack | Mechanism | Expected Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Large Payload Flood | Submit MB-sized JSON proposals | OOM in FastAPI workers |
| Connection Leak | Open thousands of idle connections | Connection pool exhaustion |
| State Accumulation | Force system to cache unbounded data | Memory leak in PostgreSQL/MinIO |
| Gradient Cache Bomb | Submit training data causing large gradient history | OOM in learner service |

### 4.2 Computational DoS

**MLP Forward Pass Exploitation:**
- High-dimensional inputs (if model accepts variable size)
- Adversarial inputs causing maximum activation paths
- Triggering worst-case computational complexity

---

## 5. Safety Gate Bypass Strategies

### 5.1 Direct Bypass Attempts

```python
# Parameter injection
{"proposal": "harmful", "bypass_safety": true}

# Header smuggling
{"proposal": "test", "X-Skip-Safety": "true"}

# Encoding obfuscation
{"proposal": "h\u0061rmful"}  # Unicode escape

# Nested payload injection
{"proposal": {"__proto__": {"safe": true}}}
```

### 5.2 Timing-Based Bypass

```python
# Race condition: Submit proposal before safety gate initializes
# TOCTOU: Modify proposal after safety check but before execution
```

### 5.3 Semantic Bypass

- Submit proposals that pass static safety checks but become harmful in context
- Exploit ambiguity in safety gate rules
- Chain multiple "safe" operations into harmful sequence

---

## 6. Data Pipeline Poisoning

### 6.1 Training Data Contamination

**Attack Vector**: `learner` service processes training examples without verification.

```python
# Poisoning strategies:
poisoned_batch = [
    {"input": [x, y], "label": wrong_label},  # Flip labels
    {"input": [outlier, outlier], "label": valid},  # Shift distribution
    {"input": [trigger, normal], "label": target},  # Backdoor
]
```

**Impact Assessment:**
- Model accuracy degradation over time
- Specific misclassification patterns (backdoors)
- Gradient explosion leading to NaN parameters

### 6.2 MinIO Object Storage Exploitation

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- Default credentials (`minioadmin:minioadmin`) in `.env`
- No documented encryption at rest
- No integrity verification for stored models
- Possible object overwrite attacks

---

## 7. Observability Blind Spots

### 7.1 Metrics as Attack Surface

**Prometheus Endpoints**: Each service exposes `/metrics`

**Exploitation:**
- Scrape metrics to learn model architecture details
- Infer training data characteristics from distributions
- Discover rate limiting and resource constraints
- Time side-channel attacks based on metric patterns

### 7.2 Health Check Vulnerabilities

```python
# Health checks may leak information:
GET /health
→ {"status": "healthy", "model_version": "v1.2.3", "last_update": "..."}

# Potential enumeration attack
for service in services:
    health = requests.get(f"{service}/health")
    # Learn internal state, versions, dependencies
```

## 8. Integration Test Weakness Analysis

### Current Test Suite Gaps (Inferred)

Based on "Add Adversarial Test Cases" TODO, the current tests likely only verify:
- ✓ Services are running
- ✓ Basic request/response flow
- ✓ Happy path integration

**Missing Red Team Coverage:**
- ✗ Failure injection testing
- ✗ Load testing under adversarial conditions
- ✗ Security boundary validation
- ✗ Byzantine fault tolerance
- ✗ Model robustness testing
