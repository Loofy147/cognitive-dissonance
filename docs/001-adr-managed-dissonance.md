# ADR-001: Using Managed Dissonance as a Controlled Regularizer

**Date**: 2025-10-05

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

In complex machine learning systems, maintaining model robustness, calibration, and generalization over time is a significant challenge. Models can become overconfident or fail silently when faced with data drift or adversarial scenarios not seen during training. Traditional approaches often rely on periodic retraining, which can be slow, or purely adversarial training, which may not cover all types of logical inconsistencies.

We need a mechanism to continuously test, challenge, and improve our models in a controlled and safe manner, directly using internal signals to drive improvement.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **"Self-Cognitive Dissonance"** framework. This system will use the disagreement and conflict between a heterogeneous pool of internal models ("Proposers") and a dedicated "Critic" component as a primary signal for self-improvement.

This dissonance will be formulated as a loss term (`Loss_dissonance`) and added to the primary task loss, governed by a dynamic, meta-learned coefficient (`λ`). This approach treats dissonance not as an error, but as a feature—a regularizer that encourages the system to explore its own uncertainties and boundaries.

The core components of this decision are:
1.  **Proposer Pool**: An ensemble of diverse models.
2.  **Critic/Contradictor**: A generator of challenging and contradictory examples.
3.  **Meta-Controller**: A component to manage the "dose" of dissonance (`λ`) and the target level of dissonance (`D_target`).
4.  **Safety Gates**: Strict, non-negotiable checks (e.g., performance on a "golden holdout" dataset) to ensure that this internal pressure for improvement does not lead to a degradation of real-world performance.

## Alternatives Considered

1.  **No Dissonance (Standard MLOps)**: Continue with a traditional approach of periodic model retraining on new data.
    - **Pros**: Simpler, well-understood process.
    - **Cons**: Reactive, not proactive. Fails to anticipate and protect against adversarial or logical failures. Can be slow to adapt.

2.  **Adversarial-Only Training**: Focus exclusively on training models to be robust against adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD).
    - **Pros**: Proven to improve robustness against specific threat models.
    - **Cons**: Can be a zero-sum game (cat and mouse). May not improve general calibration or handle logical/constraint-based contradictions that aren't strictly "adversarial." Can lead to "robust overfitting."

3.  **Human-Only Red-Teaming**: Rely exclusively on human experts to find flaws and edge cases in the models.
    - **Pros**: Excellent for finding complex, semantic, or logical flaws that algorithms might miss.
    - **Cons**: Extremely slow, expensive, and not scalable. Cannot be used as a continuous, real-time signal for improvement.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Proactive Improvement**: The system is designed to find its own weaknesses and improve continuously.
- **Improved Robustness & Calibration**: The dissonance signal directly pressures the model to become less overconfident and more aware of its decision boundaries.
- **Measurable & Controllable**: The Meta-Controller provides explicit knobs (`λ`, `D_target`) to manage the trade-off between exploration (dissonance) and exploitation (primary task performance).
- **Safety-First**: The architecture mandates safety gates and a golden holdout dataset, ensuring that internal improvements are validated against real-world metrics before deployment.

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: The system is significantly more complex than a standard ML deployment pipeline. It requires more components, more sophisticated monitoring, and careful management.
- **Need for a "Dissonance Budget"**: There is a computational cost associated with generating contradictions and evaluating dissonance. This "dissonance budget" must be managed.
- **Risk of "Dissonance Overfitting"**: If not managed properly by the Meta-Controller and Safety Gates, the system could optimize for internal metrics at the expense of the primary task. The golden holdout is critical to mitigate this.
- **Requires Sophisticated Infrastructure**: The system assumes a mature infrastructure (Kubernetes, service-based architecture, robust MLOps tooling) to be effective.
